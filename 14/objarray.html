    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    let age2 = age;

    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    
    // one way
    const players2 = players.slice();
    players[0] = 'Jason';
    console.log(players, players2);
    
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const players3 = [].concat(players);
    players3[0] = 'Paula';
    console.log(players3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const players4 = ['JBJ', ...players];
    console.log(players4);

    const players5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99});
    console.log(person, person2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
